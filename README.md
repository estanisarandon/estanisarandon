### Hi there 👋

After a decade of working on sustainability ️️♻️, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a developer 🖥️.
I have always had a curious mind about how things work; I like to open, inspect, test, and repair things. 
Since I learned to program, I have wanted to merge these two interests

- 🎓 IoT developer graduated in 2023
- 🪛 Searching from hands-on experiences, learning from failures, and unstructured time to explore and invent.
- 🚀 Looking for a workplace where I can put all this passion and curiosity into action.
